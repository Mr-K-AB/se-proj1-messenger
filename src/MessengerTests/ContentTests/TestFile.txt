Chandrayaan 3, India's third lunar exploration mission, was officially announced by ISRO Chairman, S. Somanath (https://www.isro.gov.in/Secretaryisro.html) on January 1, 2023 . The ambitious project aimed to build upon the successes of its predecessors, Chandrayaan 1 (launched on 22 Oct.  2008) and Chandrayaan 2 (launched on July 22, 2019). Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST as scheduled, from Satish Dhawan Space Centre Second Launch Pad in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India. TransLunar Injection was done on 2023 August 1. The spacecraft entered lunar orbit on 5 Aug 2023, with an expected landing near the lunar South Pole on the 23rd of August. On 5/08/2023, ISRO performed a lunar-orbit insertion (LOI), successfully placing the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft into orbit around the Moon. The LOI operation was carried out from the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking, and Command Network (ISTRAC) located in Bengaluru.
On 17 August, after a series of lunar-bound maneuvers, the Vikram lander separated from the propulsion module to begin the last phase of the mission. Chandrayaan-3 lander and rover landed near the lunar south pole region on August 23, making India the first nation to successfully land a spacecraft near the lunar south pole, and the fourth country to soft-land on the Moon.
